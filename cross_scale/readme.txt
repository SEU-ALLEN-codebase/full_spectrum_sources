# Feature Generation of Morphometry at Various Scales

We aim to obtain cross-scale morphometry features for the gold standards (SEU-A1891, manually annotated single neuron morphologies) by merging features from five morphometry levels, which include microenvironment, full morphology, motif, bouton, and arbors. Each of these features is calculated and stored in separate analysis folders.

- **Microenvironment**: These features are estimated using the file "../../microenviron/data/gold_standard_me.csv," generated by the script "../../microenviron/analyses/predict_types.py."

- **Full Morphology**: Features are extracted from "../../full_morpho/data/feature.txt" using the script "../../full_morpho/analyses/sdmatrix.py."

- **Arbor**: Features are stored in "../../arbors/data_examples/features_r2_somaTypes_{apical/basal/axonal}.csv," generated by the script "../../arbors/analyses/arbor_analyzer_r2.py."

- **Motif**: Features are collected in "../../motif/data/motif_features.csv" through the script "../../motif/analyses/sdmatrix.py."

- **Bouton**: These features are derived from the concatenation of the feature files for all neurons, available in "../../bouton/data/bouton_features.csv." The concatenation process is conducted using the script "../../bouton/analyses/bouton_analyzer.py."

# Analyses

1. **Generation of Multiscale Features and Pairwise Correlation Plot**: We generate multiscale features by standardizing and merging the features from various scales. Subsequently, we create a pairwise correlation plot between brain regions based on these multiscale features. This analysis is accomplished by running the script "ds_matrix_condense.py" located in the "analyses" folder. The input comprises features from all morphological levels generated in the previous step.

2. **Relationship Between Neuron Distances and Similarities**: We investigate the relationship between neuron distances (soma-to-soma and axon-to-axon) and neuron similarities. The axon-to-axon "distance" is determined by calculating the cosine distance between their axonal projections. Neuron similarity between two neurons is computed as the Pearson correlation between their multiscale features. The script "analyses/distance_vs_correlation.py" is used for this analysis, and the required input includes:
    - Soma positions for all features: "../../common_lib/misc/soma_pos_1891_v20230110.csv"
    - Correlations between neurons: "../multi-scale/corr_neuronLevel_sdmatrix_heatmap_stype_all.csv"
    - Projection file: "../../common_lib/41586_2021_3941_MOESM4_ESM_proj.csv"
    - Meta-information for the neurons: "../../common_lib/41586_2021_3941_MOESM4_ESM.csv"

3. **Analysis of Cross-Level/Scale Similarity Matrix and Ridge Plots for Intra-Regional Stereotypy**: To explore cross-level/scale similarity matrix and intra-regional stereotypy, run the script "multi-levels_analyzer.py" located in the "analyses" folder.
