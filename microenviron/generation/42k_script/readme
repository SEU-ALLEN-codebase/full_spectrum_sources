steps:
1. rm_multi: remove blocks with multi soma, output is a text list of 
passed cases.
2. enh: the images are lost after reinstall, but the script stays the 
same, so I put another here.
3. app2: the passed images are first synced to workstation and traced. 
the server was too slow for app2.
4. ntb: I traced all the ntb already on the server, and all are synced 
on the workstation. I could have do the same with app2, but ntb speed 
isn't affected, and I just happen to have enough data.
5. seg_prune: prune the app2
6. consensus: combine seg_prune result with ntb

note:

* many paths in scripts are inconsistent in this folder, because they 
were not in the same folder, so I add the proper order for them in readme.
